# odML - The open metadata markup language 

This repository contains re-usable odML templates.

It is meant as a template exchange and discussion forum for new odML templates
or updates to existing ones.

odML is a markup language to create hierachically structured documents collecting 
metadata about experiments in the Neuroscientific field.

A general introduction to odML and its usage can be found
at the [main odML page](http://www.g-node.org/odml).

If you would like to contribute and provide a new template to be shared with the
community, please create a Pull Request on this repository.
